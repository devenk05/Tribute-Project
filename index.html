                Born in 1907, <b>Bhagat Singh</b> was among the extreme revolutionary Indian freedom fighters. He was a largely controversial, though respected figure in the freedom struggle of India. This revolutionary hero was born in a Sikh family in the undivided state of Punjab and carried the legacy of his family and clinched to his patriotism till his death. He was involved in a plot in 1928 to assassinate James Scott, a British police superintendent to exact revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. The plot failed when they mistakenly killed another young police officer and Singh fled to Lahore to escape from punishment. The following year, he, along with his associates hurled a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi in protest against the implementation of the Defence of India Act and surrendered to the police. This great Indian freedom fighter was sentenced to death by hanging by the British, and executed at the age of only 23.
